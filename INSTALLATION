To install and run ViewFS-Manager, Qt libraries are required. Check the package
manager for your Linux distribution of choice and be sure to have them installed
before compiling it.

This software is a tool for the ViewOS machine ( virtualsquare.org ). It
cannot be run without it.


INSTALLATION STEPS:

Run make in the main directory to compile the program. If no errors were
found, you can copy the executable (viewfsmanager) into your preferred
binary directory. (To uninstall it you will have to remove it yourself)


Enjoy!
